# Assembly ARMv7 exercises

A set of exercises I made to practice the use of ARMv7 Assembly during the course of Computer Architecture and Operating Systems at the University of Pisa.\
It's mainly focused on array manipulation in ARMv7, but it also contains some exercises on strings and pointers.
[appello.s](https://github.com/akamaitrue/Assembly-ARMv7-code-excercises/blob/main/appello.s) is a function that calculates the following sum:\
$y= \displaystyle\sum_{i=0} ^{n-1} \text{vect[i]} \cdot x^{i}$

[sum_pow.s](https://github.com/akamaitrue/Assembly-ARMv7-code-excercises/blob/main/sum_pow.s) is a function that calculates the following sum: $y= \displaystyle\sum_{i=0} ^{n} x^{i}$

All the other functions are either self-explanatory or explained in the comments.
Errors may occur, if you find any please let me know.
edit: sorry, idk why github messed up with indentations but I cba fixing each one manually atm (TODO)
